                I was a bit nervous to be buying a secondhand phone from Amazon,
                but I couldnâ€™t be happier with my purchase!! I have a pre-paid
                data plan so I was worried that this phone wouldnâ€™t connect with
                my data plan, since the new phones donâ€™t have the physical SIM
                tray anymore, but couldnâ€™t have been easier! I bought an
                Unlocked black iPhone 14 Pro Max in excellent condition, and
                everything is PERFECT. It was super easy to set up and the phone
                works and looks great. It truly was in excellent condition.
                Highly recommend!!! ðŸ–¤

                Another amazing product! Setup was seamless, and the device
                works flawlessly. It's in pristine condition, just like new.
                Definitely worth the purchase.
